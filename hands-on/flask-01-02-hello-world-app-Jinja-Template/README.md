In this hands-on training I create a Flask web application on my local and build a simple web application. This is my first study with Flask.

Flask is a web application development framework written in Python. It is a micro-framework that provides only the essential components which makes it easier to begin with when compared to full-stack frameworks like Django which has boilerplate code and dependencies. And yet, Flask provides libraries, tools, and modules to develop web applications with additional features like authentication, database ORM, etc.
